# Hello:wave:, and welcome to my GitHub profile!


Hi! I'm **Javier Feliu**, a **full-stack web developer** from Panama City, Panama.  I consider myself a *curious* and *self-directed* individual.  
These qualities make an excellent match for web development, which requires mastering the basics while staying on top of constantly changing trends.

## What's my development setup?

-   :computer: My laptop runs on **Windows 10 Pro**
-   :man_technologist: For my terminal, I user **Ubuntu 18.04** running on **WSL**.
-   :hammer_and_wrench: For IDEs, I use **PyCharm**, **WebStorm**, and **DataGrip** for back-end, front-end, and database work, respectively. I also use **Postman** when working on RESTful APIs.
-   :whale: For containerization, I use **Docker**.
-   :elephant: For databases, I mainly use **PostgreSQL**.
-   :ocean: Currently, I deploy all my projects to a **Kubernetes** cluster running on **DigitalOcean**.

## What's my typical coding day?

-   :snake: If working on a back-end, I would most likely be coding a RESTful API to perform CRUD on a PostgreSQL database. I would use **Python** with **Flask**, **SQLAlchemy**, **Marshmallow**, **JWT-Extended**, and **UnitTest**.
-   :cup_with_straw: If working on a front-end, I would most likely use **jQuery** for DOM manipulation, **Nunjucks** for templating, **Bulma** for styling, and **Gulp** for workflow automation.
-   :shopping_cart: Lately, I've been doing some Shopify development.  I like it!  It's a joy to work with Liquid.  You can get fantastic results with moderate coding effort.

## What am I working on?

-   :muscle: Currently, I'm working on Atelier M's online store.  Check it out [here](https://atelierm.store).
-   :robot: I'm also tweaking [my crypto trading bots](https://github.com/wanderindev/crypto-bot). 
-   :snake: And contributing to [Python Panama's RESTful API](https://github.com/pythonpanama/python-panama-backend).

## What am I blogging about?

-   :bulb: I'm working on a series of articles exploring the topic of **relational database design for full-stack developers**.
-   :dart: Visit my blog, **Wander In Dev**, [here](https://wanderin.dev).

## What am I currently learning?

-  :school: I just started  [Udacity's Intermediate Python nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intermediate-python-nanodegree--nd303).
        
## Some helpful resources

-  üêï [Flask Web Development](https://www.amazon.com/Flask-Web-Development-Developing-Applications-dp-1491991739/dp/1491991739/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1596075644) is a great hands-on book by [Miguel Grinberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelgrinberg/) on building a web application using Flask.  It covers everything, from creating a virtual environment to application deployment.  I use Flask a lot, and I often refer to this book.  Miguel's [blog](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/) is also a great source of information.
-  üêç [Effective Python](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134853989/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=effective+python&qid=1596076710&s=books&sr=1-3) by [Brett Slatkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bslatkin/) is a great book full of advice that will help anyone write better Python code.  The book contains a bunch of self-contained lessons that shine a light into the language strengths and expressiveness.  It is truly excellent!
-  ü¶à [Essential SQLAlchemy](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=essential+sqlalchemy&i=stripbooks&crid=2XVVALUOWYFOM&sprefix=essential+sql%2Cstripbooks%2C243&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_13) by [Jason Myers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonamyers/) and [Rick Copeland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rickcopeland/) covers everything you need to know about this useful library in less than 200 pages, including the SQLALchemy core, the SQLAlchemy ORM, Alembic, and a short cookbook.
-  üêò [Six-Step Relational Database Design](https://www.amazon.com/Six-Step-Relational-Database-Design-development/dp/1481942727/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=six+step+relational+database+design&qid=1587265197&sr=8-1) by [Fidel A. Captain](https://www.fidelcaptain.com/) is an excellent practical book.  It covers the entire database design process from studying the customer's requirements to design implementation.  To illustrate each design step, the author uses three case studies of different degrees of complexity.
